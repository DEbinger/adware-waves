 You hate pop up ads right? So do we! So we decided to make pop up ads fun to remove that nasty negative stigma. Much like popping that pesky pimple, there's a certain euphoric feeling 'x-ing' out of a particularly annoying pop up - you know the feeling.

 OUR GOAL:

 Create a game that loads pop ups in intervals/set timeouts with animations that cause the pop up to grow in size until it overtakes your screen! 

 YOUR GOAL: 

 X-out of the pop up as fast as possible...but beware! Like a Hydra (not the Marvel one) when you cut off 1 head, 2 shall take it's place! Only these will grow faster, and the x may be harder to find...MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
