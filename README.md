 W.A.A.V.E? (Why Are Ads Virtually Everywhere?)

 You hate pop up ads right? So do we! So we decided to make pop up ads fun to remove that nasty negative stigma. Much like popping that pesky pimple, there's a certain euphoric feeling about killing an obtrusive ad - you know the feeling!

 OUR GOAL:

 Create a game that loads pop ups in intervals/set timeouts to your workstation. Once the ad has fully resolved it will crash your work station and plug it's product for good measure!

 YOUR GOAL: 

 Kill these ads as fast as possible...but beware! Killing an ad will instigate a new one in it's place until all the ads are gone! Each 'level' increases the quantity of ads to fight off as well as making the ads load faster...and faster...and faster. This game is not only about speed, but also endurance! Make sure to write the proper 'curl' request in the CLI to kill the ad before it resolves and destroys your workstation! ...MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
